## ðŸš€ Major Enhancements

### 1. **Enhanced Security Sandbox** (`src/security/sandbox.ts`)

Implemented a comprehensive security system following modern security best practices:

- **Multi-layered Command Validation**: Advanced pattern matching for dangerous operations
- **Environment Sanitization**: Removes sensitive environment variables during execution
- **Output Validation**: Detects credential leaks in command output
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents memory exhaustion and timeout protection
- **Safe Command Allowlists**: Restricts execution to vetted development tools

**Benefits:**
- Prevents accidental system damage
- Protects against credential exposure
- Ensures safe CI/CD integration

### 2. **Advanced Workspace Management** (`src/workspace/manager.ts`)

Implemented a comprehensive workspace system for project-aware development:

- **Project-Aware Settings**: Automatic framework detection and optimized defaults
- **Persistent Configurations**: Per-project themes, providers, and tool preferences
- **Session History**: Complete audit trail with analytics and cost tracking
- **Smart Bookmarking**: Context-aware project navigation
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Usage patterns, success rates, and provider performance

**Benefits:**
- Faster project setup with smart defaults
- Consistent development environment across sessions
- Data-driven insights for optimization

### 3. **Unix-Style Piping Support** (`src/tools/pipe.ts`)

Following Unix composability principles:

- **Command Chaining**: `termcode "analyze code" | grep "error" | head -10`
- **Data Pipeline Processing**: Stream task outputs through standard Unix tools
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Error Propagation**: Proper error handling across pipe stages

**Benefits:**
- Power user workflows
- Integration with existing toolchains
- Scriptable automation

### 4. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Foundation** (`src/mcp/client.ts`)

Foundation for external data integration following MCP standards:

- **Server Connection Management**: Connect to external data sources
- **Resource Discovery**: Automatic detection of available tools and data
- **Context Integration**: Seamless inclusion of external context in conversations
- **Protocol Compliance**: Follows MCP specification for compatibility

**Benefits:**
- Extensible architecture for future integrations
- Standardized external data access
- Enterprise-ready context management

### 5. **Intelligent Error Handling** (`src/error/handler.ts`)

Modern error handling with intelligent recovery:

- **Pattern-Based Recognition**: Categorizes errors by type (auth, network, config, etc.)
- **Actionable Suggestions**: Context-aware recovery recommendations
- **Auto-Recovery Attempts**: Automatic fixes for common issues
- **Error Analytics**: Track patterns and improve system reliability

**Benefits:**
- Reduced user frustration
- Faster problem resolution
- Proactive system improvement

### 6. **Enhanced Terminal UX** (`src/ui/terminal.ts`)

Improved visual design and user experience:

- **Multiple Themes**: Claude-inspired, minimal, and default color schemes
- **Contextual Help**: Categorized command reference with examples
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback for long-running operations
- **Smart Formatting**: Enhanced status displays and error presentation

**Benefits:**
- Improved user experience
- Reduced cognitive load
- Professional appearance

### 7. **Advanced Project Detection** (`src/tools/test.ts`)

Enhanced project understanding and framework recognition:

- **Framework Recognition**: React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, Express, FastAPI, etc.
- **Toolchain Detection**: Build tools, test runners, linters automatically identified
- **Context Building**: Rich project metadata for better AI responses
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understanding of project structure and requirements

**Benefits:**
- More accurate AI responses
- Better tool integration
- Faster onboarding
